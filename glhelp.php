      <h2>Complete Walkthrough <span class="smalltext">Courtesy of <a href="mailto:lance@betanightclub.com">Lance Dunlap</a></span></h2>
      <p>We will be using two platforms to build & submit your guests:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://tech.betanightclub.com/gl/" target="_blank">Beta Nightclub Guest List Form Administration Utility</a>
            <br /><span class="smalltext">http://tech.betanightclub.com/gl/ (you can also use the shortened URL: <a href="http://betate.ch" target="_blank">http://betate.ch</a>)</span></li>
          <li><a href="http://vipdoorlist.com" target="_blank">VIP Doorlist</a>
            <br /><span class="smalltext">http://vipdoorlist.com</span></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Sign In</h3>
      <p>Beta Nightclub Guest List Form Administration Utility (the website you are currently viewing) is the platform you will use to build/compile your guests leading up to the show. For those familiar with our previous guest list sign-up forms, these will look identical, but are no longer based on a Google Docs infrastructure.</p>
      <p>To login to your account:
        <ul>
          <li>Go to: <a href="http://tech.betanightclub.com/gl/" target="_blank">http://tech.betanightclub.com/gl/</a>
            <br /><span class="smalltext">This link opens a new window, so you can continue reading while you use the website.</span></li>
          <li>When you are prompted to log in, enter your email address and the temporary password that was sent to you.
            <br /><span class="smalltext">(You can skip this, because if you're reading this, you're already logged in. Congratulations!)</span></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Artist Profile</h3>
      <p>The next step is going to be updating your "profile" and setting your password to whatever you'd like. To do this:
        <ul>
          <li>Click the menu button in the top right corner,</li>
          <li>Select "Manage Account",</li>
          <li>Confirm your artist name is entered correctly,</li>
          <li>Add/modify your social media links that you would like to appear on your forms (Facebook page, Twitter account, Soundcloud link, etc...) per the instructions, paste one link per line,</li>
          <li>Ignore the Custom Fields area for now,</li>
          <li>Confirm your email address,</li>
          <li>Enter your new password in the 'Password' field,</li>
          <li>Click "Submit".</li>
        </ul>
        Your profile is now updated and password reset to your choosing. If you forget your email address or password, you'll have to <a href="mailto:justin@betanightclub.com">email Justin</a> to have them reset for you. He's cranky, so please try not to do that.</p>
      <h3>Viewing Forms/Events</h3>
      <p>Now let's take a look at your lists for upcoming events:
        <ul>
          <li>Click the menu button in the top right corner</li>
          <li>Select "View Events"</li>
          <li>If you have any shows coming up, you should see a list of events that looks similar to this:
            <br /><img src="glhelp_ss01.png" style="border:1px solid gray;width:90%;"></li>
          <li>You'll see a few obvious things such as the show date, who the headliner is, and time remaining until your list will cut off.
            <br /><b>Please note that list sign-ups will be cut-off at 7pm the day of show.</b></li>
          <li>You'll also see a few other things including:
            <dl>
              <dt>Count (Limit):</dt><dd>This will detail out your guest list allotments for the show.  "All" refers to the total number of spots you have for 21+ & 18+, whereas the "21+" & "18+" individual allotments are displayed next to that. If you ever see (-1), that means you have have unlimited spots for that list.</dd>
              <dt>Form link:</dt><dd>This is the live link to promote your guest list with. If you click on it, you'll see the live end, which is what users will see when they go to sign-up. It is crucial you market with your guest list form to redeem as many sign-ups/check-ins as possible.</dd>
            </dl></li>
          <li>There are also 2 buttons and one drop down menu above that information:
            <dl>
              <dt>View:</dt><dd>This button will open a window containing all the sign-up data captured from the form, inclusive of email addresses, age, sex, etc.</dd>
              <dt>Export:</dt><dd>This button will open a window containing ONLY the names signed up, separated by 21+ & 18+.  This is the feature you will use to copy & paste names into VIP Doorlist.</dd>
              <dt>"Active" drop-down menu:</dt><dd>As a general rule of thumb, leave this set to "Active." There may be times when you are instructed to either "Pause" or "Close" the list (for example, sold out shows), but for now you can leave this setting as is.</dd>
            </dl></li>
        </ul>
        For the most part you will only be signing into your account and hitting View/Export.</p>
      <h3>VIP Doorlist</h3>
      <p>Now onto VIPdoorlist.com, which most of you are already familiar with and you should still be able to sign into your accounts. If you are unable to, please let me know and I will reset your password. For those of you that are new to the team, VIP Doorlist is the platform we use that actually submits your guest list to our door staff, who will be checking your guests in at the show. This is where you will copy & paste the names from the "Export" window into.</p>
      <p>To sign-in to your account:
        <ul>
          <li>Go to: <a href="http://vipdoorlist.com" target="_blank">http://vipdoorlist.com</a>
          <br /><span class="smalltext">(Again, this link opens in a new window, so you can follow along.)</span></li>
          <li>Enter your email address,</li>
          <li>Enter your password. For new users, you should have received an individual email to set your own password. If you didn't, please let me know. For returning users you should be able to login as usual, but if you need your password reset let me know.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>Once logged in, click the "Staff Lists" tab up top if you are not already on it. You should see 3 lists for each event you are playing that weekend (if you are not booked to play the upcomming weekend, you may not see any events listed).
        <ul>
          <li>18+ Discount list, ie: 18+ $15 before 11pm</li>
          <li>21+ Discount list, ie: 21+ $5 before 11pm</li>
          <li>21+ Free list, ie: 21+ free before 11pm</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Please note that you can use these lists at your own discretion, but will be restricted by the allotments shown on the other platform.</b> You'll also notice that since you have two 21+ lists available (discount vs. free), your live form will always advertise the discount option and mention there are limited free spots available. For those with restricted allotments, this allows you to use your free list for close friends/family/etc. before giving those spots to the people who signed up on your public form. As mentioned, you can use these lists however you'd like, so feel free to give the people who signed up first dibs on the free spots too.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the names form the first platform (either 18+ or 21+) and select the appropriate list in VIP Doorlist.</li>
          <li>Click the "Paste Guest List" link towards the bottom of the page and paste the names into the box that appears.</li>
          <li>Click Next.</li>
          <li>Confirm all names look correct, then click "Add To Guest List."</li>
          <li>Repeat as needed with other lists.</li>
        </ul>
        One thing to keep in mind is that these lists will become available on Tuesday the week of the show and the submission phase will cut-off at 8pm the day of the show. That means people will be able to sign-up on your form until 7pm and you will have until 8pm to submit your complete list. Please keep this in mind, as you do not want to miss any last minute sign-ups to your lists.</p>
      <h3>The End</h3>
      <p>Did you actually read the whole thing?! Holy crap; you deserve a cookie. Now go fill up those guest lists!</p>
